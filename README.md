a simple SYN-FLOOD lab for our CSC490 Computer security class that showcases a DOS for the telnet service using a Terminal. This exercise teaches students how to establish a TCP connection and some protections in place for current Linux systems against SYN FLOOD and DOS attacks. I have also included the slides from our presentation. It also showcases how to run and use containers as well using the docker file.
